Simon Sees is a twist on the classic Simon game, designed for [Hack Club's Sprig game console](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/). In this version, players follow a sequence of colored directional arrows. AI was used to help create this readme and small portions of the code.
